# Liver Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
This project is aimed at predicting the presence or absence of liver disease in patients using Machine Learning algorithms. We have used the Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD) obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Installation
Before running the code, you need to have the following libraries installed:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
xgboost
yellowbrick

## Usage
The main code file is AIDI_1000_Final_Project.ipynb. You can open this file in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab to run the code. Make sure that the ILPD.csv file is in the same directory as the code file.

You can run the entire code file to train and evaluate different Machine Learning models on the dataset. The output will show the accuracy and F1 scores for each model, as well as feature importance plots.
